    <h3>National Automation Robotics Challenge 2024</h3>
    <p>
      Sparsh Jain of class 8 from Delhi Public School, Bangalore South participated in the National Automation Robotics Challenge 2024, a 6‑hour hackathon held at SRM Institute of Technology on 20th September 2024. Competing in the Automation category, Sparsh, along with his teammate, developed a system that automates irrigation for farmers by measuring soil moisture, using a weather API and an AI model to predict how long crops need to be watered. Unlike basic systems that water based only on dryness, their innovation used advanced data analytics to deliver precise predictions with 95 % accuracy. They secured first place, winning a cash prize worth ₹ 7 500.
