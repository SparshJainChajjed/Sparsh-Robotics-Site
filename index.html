    <h3>National Automation Robotics Challenge 2024</h3>
    <p>
      Sparsh Jain of class 8 from Delhi Public School, Bangalore South participated in the National Automation Robotics Challenge 2024, a 6‑hour hackathon held at SRM Institute of Technology on 20th September 2024. Competing in the Automation category, Sparsh, along with his teammate, developed a system that automates irrigation for farmers by measuring soil moisture, using a weather API and an AI model to predict how long crops need to be watered. Unlike basic systems that water based only on dryness, their innovation used advanced data analytics to deliver precise predictions with 95% accuracy. They secured first place, winning a cash prize worth ₹7,500.

    <h3>Atal Marathon 2024</h3>
    <p>
      Sparsh Jain from Delhi Public School, Bangalore South was awarded a Certificate of Achievement for the project <strong>Soil Smart</strong>. His team ranked among the top 500 teams in the prestigious ATL Marathon 2023–24, organized by the Atal Innovation Mission, NITI Aayog. As a result, his team will receive government funding and mentorship from SIP Jyoti to further develop their project. Soil Smart is an IoT-driven soil health analyzer that combines pH, moisture and temperature sensors with a Raspberry Pi Zero and a custom AI model to predict optimal fertilizer and calcium dosages. It then delivers real-time recommendations via a web dashboard, helping farmers tailor soil amendments and crop choices for maximum yield.
